<h3> This project aims to present the design and functionalities of the front end, focusing on user interface and interaction. </h3>

The landing page is based on a tourism website. The header contains a link to the homepage, which is accessed by clicking on the website's name. The website has a fixed header and footer, while only the main section contains an iframe that changes as different pages are accessed.

The first page, called 'Home,' displays a list of subjects with images. When hovered over, the images scale and change opacity with an animation effect. The secondary pages feature a list of cards that expand on hover, revealing a short description of the tertiary pages. The tertiary pages contain only an image, some headings (H2), and paragraphs.

The footer includes the website's sitemap and my signature.

## Script

When I was coding this website, I didn't follow a predefined script. I simply coded piece by piece, thinking about how I could improve it. However, I documented my ideas as they came to me, so here is the script.
